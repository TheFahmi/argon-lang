// Mocking CryoWeb decorators definition (since they are built-in syntax now, we don't need to import them as functions/macros from userland necessarily, 
// but if they were just metadata, the parser handles them. 
// However, typically in other languages decorators are also functions. 
// In our implementation, they are native syntax tokens `@Name`. 
// So imports might be needed only if we want type checking or if they desugar to function calls.
// For now, let's assume they are just syntax sugar for metadata.)
